1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
   Ans: In a project, a gitignore file is used by Git to determine the files/folders to be ignored(that are not required for the project), before commiting. 
        Its basically the ignore rules which should be available to all those who clone the repository. For a Java project, a gitignore file includes
        package files like .jar, .rar, .war, .ear,.zip, .tar, etc. ; class files(.class); Log file(.file); BlueJ files(.ctxt); Mobile Tools for Java(J2ME) (.mtj.tmp/);
        virtual machine crash logs and also the specific files(bin/, tmp/, build/, etc.) of IDE(used for the project) like Eclipse, IntelliJ and build automation tool like Maven, etc.
2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
   Ans: Fast-forwarding in Git means forwarding the features of a branch while merging it to the other branch, which was previously not updated with the latest commit.
3. Why should you have different branches?
   Ans: Different branches of the repository enable users to work on different contexts of a project(like features, experiment, bugfix) efficiently.
        The branches can later be merged into one if needed.
4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
   Ans: Usually, in a project we have a single remote Git Repository(on Git Server) and multiple local repositories.
